PHPAdminimal
==============

This is a simple admin utility written in php for accessing and updating databases on the local host. A little like
phpmyadmin but without all the features. Please feel free to clone, change, comment and amend.

Tidy up Read page

Update page (update a record)

Delete page (delete a record with confirmation)
