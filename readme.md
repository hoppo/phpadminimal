PHPAdminimal
==============

This is a simple admin utility written in php for accessing and updating databases on the local host. A little like
phpmyadmin but without all the features. Please feel free to clone, change, comment and amend.

Todo
----

Table page (display selected table)

Create page (create a new record)
 
Read page (inspect a selected record more closely)

Update page (update a record)

Add a nav bar displaying; username, selected database, selected table, logout. 

Implement logout function.

Upgrade to secure php session.

Protect against brute force attacks (not sure if necessary as loclahost only?)
